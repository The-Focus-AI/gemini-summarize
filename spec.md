build a command line tool that will get a file reference to a pdf or epub file and look
   through to see who is the author, what is the title, and if it's a book or paper. 
   
   use gemini as the llm parser, and use the umwelment npm librar.
   
    if 
  it's seen the file before, it returns the cached results inside (that it keeps inside 
  of .cache)  look through a couple of fies in the ~/Downloads or ~/Desktop as test files


An example of this is in https://github.com/The-Focus-AI/umwelten/blob/main/scripts/pdf-parsing.ts

but use google gemini
